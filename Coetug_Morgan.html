              <p align="center"><img src="Pix/Officers/Coetug_Morgan.gif" width="209" height="221"></p>
              <p>Daylight&rsquo;s secretary <strong>Coe  Morgan</strong> is the lodge&rsquo;s senior elected officer both in age and length of  service.&nbsp; He joined Daylight in 1968 from  Burien&rsquo;s South Gate Lodge No 247. His family traditions both Masonic and  otherwise go back several generations.&nbsp; He  was born in Kent, Washington in 1934, part of a pioneer Burien-Highline  area family on his mother&rsquo;s side that settled in what is now Normandy Park  and Sunnydale in the early 1880s.&nbsp; His  father Tug was from a family that settled a little later in that century in the  Georgetown area  of Seattle. His  uncles were early members of Home Lodge No. 100.&nbsp; Both Coe and his father were both members of South  Gate Lodge; he became a member in 1956 at the age of 21. He was Master  Councilor of Highline Chapter, DeMolay for Boys in Burien and is now a member  of the DeMolay Legion of Honor.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Through theater and church he was friends with Daylight&rsquo;s  secretary George Peckham who frequently urged him to visit the Daylight. &nbsp;He joined in 1968 and served as Master in 1973.  Two years later he was elected secretary.&nbsp;  In 1999 and 2000 he was the Master of Tyee &#8470;. 115, the Wayfarer&rsquo;s  Daylight Lodge in Renton  and was very instrumental in revitalizing it.&nbsp;  He is a Past High Priest of Oriental Chapter No. 19, Royal Arch Masons. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The 1980 Grand Master appointed him as his Deputy in  District &#8470;. 5. He has been Grand Historian and Grand Orator plus served on numerous  Grand Lodge committees. During the June 2007 Grand Lodge meeting, in  recognition of his work with the Grand Secretary he was invested with the  honorary title of Assistant Grand Secretary-emeritus. As one of the senior  lodge secretaries in the Grand Lodge he has been part of the Grand Secretary&rsquo;s  team training newly installed secretaries. He was a founding member and the  first General Secretary of the North American Conference of Daylight Lodges.</p>
              <p>He follows a long family tradition in serving his community.  He is a member and has been Chair of the Sound Transit Citizen&rsquo;s Accessibility  Advisory Committee. At a state level, he represented the Masonic fraternity on  the Washington Territorial Sesquicentennial Commission. For the celebration &nbsp;he prepared a research paper on Washington  Masonic Politicians; a compendium of Masonic Governors, Senators and Representatives  of the territory and state.&nbsp; Governor Mike  Lowery appointed him a commissioner on the Washington State Arts Commission. He  also served as secretary of the Board of Trustees of the Seattle Chamber  Players. &nbsp;For nearly twenty years he  worked part-time in Seattle  theater earning his Actor&rsquo;s Equity card. In the early 1970s with W&there4;  Allen Carter he ran his own small theater, an adventure that soon convinced him  the theater was a &ldquo;not for profit&rdquo; business.&nbsp;  He continues to be supportive of local theaters and an avid opera fan  traveling to many opera houses to see many different operas, especially  contemporary works.&nbsp; He is very  supportive of Senior Warden Anderson&rsquo;s wife Carla in her goal of becoming an  &ldquo;opera diva.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>A member of the Machinist Union (IAM&amp;AW) for more than  twenty years he was an elected officer; eighteen as a local or district lodge  president. For ten years he was on the Advisory Board of the Labor Center  at The Evergreen State College.&nbsp; The March  1990 Masonic Service Association of North America&rsquo;s Short Talk Bulletin &ldquo;<em>Daylight Masonry, An Old Idea Renewed.&rdquo; &nbsp;</em>was his brief history of daylight  Masonry.&nbsp; Early in the 20th  Century his great grandfather Henry Blaker sold produce from his Sunnydale farm  at Seattle&rsquo;s  Pike Place Market. Now more-or-less retired Morgan spends Mondays as a  volunteer at the Market&rsquo;s 1st    Avenue and Pike Street Information Booth.</p>
