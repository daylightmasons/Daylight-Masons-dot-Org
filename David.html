              <p align="center" class="style3">V<strong>&there4;</strong>W<strong>&there4;</strong>  DAVID JULIAN &ndash; MUSICIAN</p>
              <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="Pix/Officers/mia.jpg" width="115" height="105"></p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>David Julian</strong>, Daylight&rsquo;s musician of few equals  is a Past Master thrice over.&nbsp; He first  served the lodge as Master in 1989 and then again in 2001-2002 and  2002-</p>
              <p class="style2">2003.&nbsp; In 2002 when asked to take  the job of Master a third time, he agreed provided the young members found a  way to rejuvenate the lodge and with the help of Anthony   Monaco, Raleigh Wilson, Rob Pitre and Past Master Jay Losey, lead the way to the lodge&rsquo;s current  growth and success by being supportive of the young member&rsquo;s different ideas  and plan.</p>
              <p class="style2">He served as the Grand Musician for Grand Lodge several  times.&nbsp; Prior to June 2005 the office was  called Grand Organist but Brother David complained that he was not an organist  but actually a musician and at Daylight&rsquo;s suggestion the Grand Lodge agreed and  changed the official title not only for Grand Lodge but in all Washington lodges.&nbsp; He also served as Grand Bible Bearer in  1997-1998 and is one of six Daylight members who have been the Deputy of the  Grand Master in District &#8470;. 5.&nbsp; He served  for two years from 1998-2000.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">He was born in Derry,   New Hampshire February 23, 1947.&nbsp; He comes from a Masonic background, his  father W\  John Julian is a Past Master of Manitou Lodge No. 68 in Colorado.&nbsp;  At the 1983 Installation of Officers Doric Lodge No. 92 in Seattle&rsquo;s Fremont neighborhood, David  furnished the entertainment for a friend who had just been installed as the new  Worshipful Master. When asked if he was a Mason, he explained that even though  his father was a Past Master, because he worked nights he could not be  one.&nbsp; Wrong thing to say to a future  Grand Master who promptly directed him to Daylight&rsquo;s secretary and in June of  1983 his father helped raise him as a Master Mason. As a club type musician  entertainer, as he has brought a more up to date, refreshingly contemporary  sound to the lodge and Grand Lodge meetings.</p>
              <p class="style2">Like many musicians he attended a college music school to  study how to play &lsquo;music&rsquo; but soon decided that doing was better than all the  professor&rsquo;s theories and lectures.&nbsp; He  felt that the real world of actual performing was by far the best teacher so he  left the University of Colorado School of Music to appear in concerts and  night-clubs, to produce radio and TV commercials.&nbsp; Now retired from full time club work, his  current occupation is rescuing computer hard drives that crash.&nbsp; He now performs in a musical duo called Emmaus Road, a  prison ministry under the umbrella of Prisoners for Christ.</p>
              <p align="center" class="style1">DAVID Y. CHOE &ndash; JUNIOR  WARDEN </p>
              <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="file:///C|/Documents and Settings/rrodgers/Desktop/Lodge/mia.jpg" width="113" height="113"></p>
              <p class="style2">The third most important officer in the lodge, <strong>David Choe</strong> was born in Seoul, South    Korea December 4, 1971 but raised in the United States.&nbsp; He became a full American citizen on July 4, 2006.&nbsp; His early years were spent in the Queens, New    York and later in Minneapolis/St. Paul. He is one of  the many members who made their first contact with the lodge through this web  site.&nbsp; He started his Masonic journey in  November 2003 and was made a Master Mason on February 21, 2004. He promptly became a very  active and involved member. Worshipful Master Rob Pitre appointed to office as the  2004-2005 Chaplain, a position he held for two years before becoming Senior  Deacon in 2006-2007.&nbsp; On July 21, 2007 he became  part of the elected line of officers as Junior Warden for 2007-2008 when he was  installed into that office by Past Grand Master Sat   Tashiro.</p>
              <p class="style2">He is an outstanding photographer and provides most of the photographs  for Daylight&rsquo;s web site and lodge Trestleboard. As his work schedule permits he  also does some photos for Grand Lodge.&nbsp;  An accomplished water color artist too, this talent relates to his  profession; he is in an unusual field as he is tattoo artist by trade.&nbsp; More than one Mason sports a David Choe  tattoo. &nbsp;He has had several exhibits of  his photographs in different venue including the popular Crocodile Pub in Bell Town  and a recent showing of watercolors was a sold out success. &nbsp;As Junior Warden his biggest task is to  coordinate the lodge&rsquo;s yearly Honor Dinner for the Principal Players of the  Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra and even more importantly to see that the  lodge members do not go hungry at meetings and other social events.&nbsp; He is expected to see that they are always on  their best behavior.&nbsp; The members expect  him to plan social events so they can have fun. </p>
