David Julian, Daylights musician of few equals is a Past Master thrice over.  He first served the lodge as Master in 1989 and then again in 2001-2002 and 2002-2003.  He is now serving once again as the Grand Musician.  Prior to June 2005 the office was called Grand Organist but Brother David complained that he was not an organist but actually a musician and at Daylights suggestion the Grand Lodge agreed and changed the official title not only for Grand Lodge but in all Washington lodges.  He also served as Grand Bible bearing in 1997-1998 and is one of five members to have been the Deputy of the Grand Master in District # 5 from 1998-2000.  He is also musician for St. Johns Lodge # 9.

He furnished the entertainment for the 1983 Doric Lodge Installation of Officers.  When asked if he was a Mason, he explained that even though his father was a Past Master, because he worked nights he could not be one.  Wrong thing to say to a future Grand Master who promptly directed him to Daylights secretary and in June of 1983 his father helped raise him as a Master Mason. He brought a more up to date, refreshingly contemporary sound to the lodge when he became the lodge musician.

He attend college to study music but decided that practice was better than the professors theories and lectures, that the real world of performing was by far the best teacher so he left the University of Colorado School of Music to perform in concerts and night-clubs, to produce radio and TV commercials.  Now retired from full time club work, he runs his own business rescuing downed computers but continues to provide music for lodges, often with his wife Beverly.  He is also active as the leader of a small pop guitar quartet that performs in the Seattle area.  In 2002 when asked to take the job of Master a third time, he agreed provided the young members found a way to rejuvenate the lodge and with the help of Anthony Monaco and Past Master Jay Losey lead the way to the lodges current success.

                <!--<img src="w.gif" width="32" height="16" border="0" alt="">&nbsp;<em>CLEO B. McCORD - Tiler</em><br><img src="tiler.gif" width="150" height="131" border="0" align="left" alt="">He may have been born November 25, 1912 in Muncie, Indiana but Tiler Cleo McCord is a prime example of the adage, It isnt age, its attitude.  Cleo is often the first welcoming face a visitor or new members sees when he visits Daylight.   The new member being prepared to be made a Mason is sure to find Cleo guiding, advising and assuring them that they have made the right step in joining Daylight.  

Lodge records show that he was one of the oldest Masters of the lodge but his ideas have hardly been aged.  While he may not keep up with the lodges young officers physically, his ideas are very much in keeping with theirs and he believes that the future of Masonry and Daylight Lodge is now firmly in their hands.  During his year as Master in June of 1997 the lodge had its first contact with the Fremont Solstice Festival which was to lead to the highly successful band stand and Masonic Information Booth.

He first served as a Master in Spokanes North Hill Lodge # 210 in 1962.  He was made a Mason in that lodge 1948 and affiliated with Daylight shortly after moving to the Masonic Retirement Center in 1994.  He served as the Master of Wayfarers Lodge # 280 in 1995 and also is tiler for Tyee # 115, the Wayfarers Daylight Lodge in Renton.  He was Junior Grand Steward in 1997-1998.  At his age he continues to be and inspiration to Daylights kids offering them sage advise, wise counsel and encouragement to try new ideas.
