<em>ANTHONY MONACO - WORSHIPFUL MASTER</em><br><img src="ANTHONYMONCO.jpg" width="150" height="149" border="0" alt="" align="left">

The lodge’s youngest Worshipful Master in a number of years, Anthony Monaco has never-the-less been a Mason longer than any of his officers except the Treasurer and Secretary.  He became a Master Mason in January 1999 after he and a close friend felt they needed some activity that would allow them to serve their community and expand their contacts in life. In 1998 at the urging of Daylight’s secretary they sought membership.  Monaco was born in Anchorage, Alaska on September 4, only child of school and college instructors.  He spent much of his early years in the 49th State and later on Orcas Island. He wondered Europe for a time and returned to attend college graduating from the University of Washington. After graduating he first starting working with the developmentally disabled for several different social agencies until entering the computer industry.  He held of number of different lodge offices before his election in 2002 as Junior Warden and then advanced this year to the office of Worshipful Master when he was installed on July 15 by Grand Master Charles W. McQuery.   In early 2002, concerned about the lodge’s lack of direction, he gathered a meeting of the younger members to discuss the lodge’s future and lay out some plans and long rang goals.  It resulted in a decision to concentrate on good ritual, community involvement, and two year terms for elected officers and a concentrated effort of adding new and younger faces to the membership through the use of personal contact plus the lodge web site, all of which have come to pass.   


For the previous two years as Senior Warden he was responsible for the coordination of Masonic activities at the Fremont Solstice Festival which included a highly successful Masonic Information Booth and Bandstand, a venture that brought together many of the Seattle area Masonic lodges in a highly successful public relations activity.  He is now employed by King County government in their ITS Web and Applied Service Division and Senior Applications Developer.  He is one of the few lodge officers that is still active as a part time musician and his pop/rock band, “Anthony Monaco & LOOPHOLE” have not only appeared on the Daylight Bandstand at the Fremont Fair, but also at various venues around  Seattle such as the popular night spot, “The Triple Door,” “The Central Tavern,” “ Fenix Underground”  and many more.   As is often the case with musicians, he is an outstanding ritualist and has frequently been asked to assist other lodges with their degree work.  He leads one of Seattle’s youngest Masters, leads one of the area’s youngest lodges and is supported by a team of officers nearly all of whom are in their thirties.

<em>RALEIGH WILSON - SENIOR WARDEN</em><br><img src="RALEIGHWILSON.jpg" width="153" height="186" border="0" align="left" alt=""><br>
Senior Warden Raleigh Wilson is about eleven months younger than his long time best friend  Worshipful Brother Rob Pitre, who was the lodge’s Master for the last two years. They joined the lodge at the same time after attending the Masonic funeral for his wife’s grandfather. After seeing the ceremony they agreed that something was missing in life and Masonry seemed like a potentially intriguing place to search. He has said that he has found what he was looking for, “Daylight is a true fraternity which connects good men and unites them in support the arts in the Seattle area.”  The fact that wife Meagan had been a member of the Masonic sponsored youth group, Rainbow for Girls might have contributed just a little added encouragement in seeking membership. 


Wilson is another officer who is outstanding in his ritual work. Delivering lectures of the several degrees; he has set a high bar of achievement for younger officers.  The Daylight’s involvement in the Fremont Public Association’s Fremont Solstice Festival is a direct result of an idea he presented to the lodge.  Nearly six years ago he proposed that the lodge build a portable bandstand to take around to Seattle area street fairs and host local ‘garage bands’ etc.  The Worshipful Master then gave him the task of putting it together. The portable bandstand idea was not a success but as a result of his initial contact, in 2000 the Fremont Fair asked the lodge to sponsor one of their major bandstands which it has done every year since.  As Senior Warden he now has the responsibility of coordinating the Masonic activities at the popular Fremont Fair. They now include the Daylight sponsored bandstand and a Seattle area Masonic Information Booth sponsored jointly by most of the lodges in the city. 


He is middle grade teacher in St. Joseph’s Middle School in Snoqualmie, He has a passionate feeling for the arts in all forms, writes poetry, paints, sings and plays guitar. In short he is a real Daylighter. All this plus raising a bevy of young girls, cats, chickens and other flora and fauna in the City of Carnation where he serves on the planning commission.

<em>ANDY ANDERSON - JUNIOR WARDEN</em><br><img src="andyanderson.jpg" width="200" height="150" border="0" align="left" alt=""><br>
The number three elected officer in the lodge is Andrew Anderson, but friends know him as Andy.  He first became aware of the Masonic Lodge after many conversations with his wife (her maternal grandfather is active with the Shrine in Portland, Oregon, and her father is a member in Montana).  He decided to join the lodge after attending, at the invitation of a lodge member, Daylight’s 2002 Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra Principal Players Honors Dinner. The lodge’s involvement in the arts and its unique support of these young musicians prompted him to petition for membership that night.  He completed his degree work as a Master Mason in July 2002.  After becoming a Master Mason, he found out that his paternal Grandfather was a member of Artesia Lodge in California, his maternal Great Grandfather was a member in Illinois, and his paternal Great-Great Grandfather was a member in Texas.

Shortly after taking his Master Mason degree he moved to Champaign, Illinois, where his wife attended the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, to study voice in the schools opera program.   After a year of study they decided to return to Seattle, and he became an appointed officer as Chaplain in the 2003-2004 Masonic year. The following year he advanced to Senior Deacon where he remained for two years as part of the lodge’s long range plan of two year terms. At the June 2006 election of officers he was chosen Junior Warden and the following month was installed into the office by the lodge’s Honorary Past Master, Right Worshipful Gale Kenney, the new Junior Grand Warden. 

A native Californian, he was born in April 1975 in Garden Grove (ten minutes away from Disneyland).   He graduated from Pacifica High School where he was a four year starter on the varsity soccer team.  He was active participant in the Garden Grove United Methodist church choir and youth program.   He attended Seattle Pacific University earning a Bachelor of Arts in Communication and later Seattle University where he received a Master of Education in Student Development Administration.  He is employed at Seattle University as an Associate Registrar.  He is a diehard sports fan (Chicago Bears RULE!), and enjoys attending the Seattle Opera.  He also enjoys a nice 7 & 7 with friends or playing Nintendo.  

He is solid support of his wife’s goal of becoming an opera diva.  He and Carla Hilderbrand (www.carlahilderbrand.com) live just north of Ballard, the Seattle district once predominated by Scandinavians (and due to his Swedish heritage he feels right at home), with their eye-catching dog, a Basset Hound/German Shephard mix, named Molly.  He is happy to hold down the homestead while she performs.  Carla will be performing in Portland Opera’s 2007 Young Artist Program.

<img src="w.gif" width="32" height="16" border="0" alt="">&nbsp;<em>JAMES R. MAHER – TREASURER</em><br> 
<img src="JamesMaher.jpg" width="150" height="168" border="0" alt="" align="left">
He may have been born in “Mile High City”, Denver Colorado on December 14, 1962, but the lodge’s treasurer Jim Maher is really a Washingtonian to the core.  He comes from a family with Masonic roots in the Bellingham area where his grandfather served as Master of Fairhaven Lodge #  73.  Some members claim he has one slight defect, he is a Cougar from Washington State University in Pullman, a fact the lodge really doesn’t hold against him as the lodge’s Brother Roy Pollock is a musician in the Cougar Alumni Band.  


Maher became a Mason in Tyee Lodge # 115 in Renton. He gave his proficiency in January 1989; barely dry behind the ears as a Mason he promptly left on a trip to British Isles and visited lodges in Scotland including the Grand Lodge. Four months later he took a plural membership in Daylight.  He was one of several Tyee members who convinced that lodge to successfully change to daytime meetings.   


He served two terms as Daylight’s Master, first in 1993-94 and then a second year in 1997-98.  When the lodge’s treasurer Don Ward suffered a stroke and died in the summer of 1999 he was appointed to fill the office and has been re-elected yearly since.  His expertise as a Chartered Financial Analyst [CFA] has proven to be a valuable asset to the financial well being of Daylight Lodge.  In 2001 his value in this field was also recognized on the Grand Lodge level and he was appointed as ad-hoc member of the Masonic Retirement Center Board of Trustees, the following year he became a full member and also was named to the Grand Lodge Finance Committee. He continues to serve on both.    As a member of the MRC Trustees, he has been a member of a sub-committee responsible for the re-development of the Center as the Landmark on the Sound.  Traveling around the state as well as to various Masonic retirement facilities around the nation, he spent many hours in the re-development of the obsolete 1926 landmark building to bring it up the date as a 21st Century retirement community of which Masonry can be proud.   


On June 9, 2006 he was installed as the new Deputy of the Grand Master in District No. 5 representing Grand Master Charles W. McQuery to nine lodges in the Seattle area.  He joins six other, three living, Daylight Past Masters who have held the title of Very Worshipful. In his spare time he is a father devoted to a young daughter who this past summer became a member of the Masonic youth group Rainbow for Girls.  He is also active in his local church keeping their finances in shape, volunteers part time at the South King County 911 Center and is member of the Board of Trustees of the Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestras.

Daylight’s secretary for over thirty years, Coe Morgan has doggedly served Daylight since joining the lodge in 1968. His family Masonic traditions go back several generations in Burien and Georgetown (south Seattle area).  In 1956 at the age of 21 be became a Mason in South Gate Lodge # 247 in Burien south of Seattle.  He was Master Councilor of Highline Chapter, DeMolay for Boys in Burien and is now a member of the DeMolay Legion of Honor.   


He was born in Kent, Washington in 1934, part of a Burien-Highline area pioneer family. When active in local theater in the 1950s and 1960s, he became friends with Daylight’s secretary George Peckham who handled Actor’s Equity problems for local actors and he was invited to visit Daylight Lodge.  He served as Master in 1973 and was elected secretary two years later.  He also served two years in the late 1990s as the Master of Tyee # 115, the Wayfarer’s Daylight Lodge in Renton.    He became the first member of the lodge in thirty years to serve as a Deputy of the Grand Master in District # 5 appointed in 1980. He has held a number of Grand Lodge positions including Grand Historian and Grand Orator and on numerous committees. As one of the senior lodge secretaries in the Grand Lodge he is part of the Grand Secretary’s team training newly installed secretaries.  He was one of the founding members of the North American Conference of Daylight Lodges and was its first General Secretary from 1988 until 2004. As of November 2006 he will serve as High Priest of Oriental Chapter No. 19, Royal Arch Masons. 


Following a family tradition of being a community activist, he retired in November 2005 as the Chair of the Sound Transit Citizen’s Accessibility Advisory Committee.  On a state level, he most recently represented the Masonic fraternity as a member of Washington Territorial Sesquicentennial Commission. For that Centennial he prepared a research paper on Washington Masonic Politicians; a compendium of Masonic Governors, US Senators and Representatives elected to office in the territory and state.  He was a governor appointed commissioner for five years on the Washington State Arts Commission and also served as secretary of the Board of Trustees of the Seattle Chamber Players. For more than twenty years he was an elected officer in the Machinist Union (IAM&AW), eighteen as a local or district lodge president. He represented that union for nearly ten years on the Advisory Board of the Labor Center at The Evergreen State College.  The Masonic Service Association of North America published his brief history of daylight Masonry as a Short Talk Bulletin March 1990 “Daylight Masonry, An Old Idea Renewed.” Now retired, he spends Mondays as a volunteer at the Information Booth at the 1st Avenue and Pike Street entrance to Seattle’s Pike Place Market, a market where his great grandfather sold produce in the early days of the 20th Century.

<img src="vw.gif" width="53" height="16" border="0" alt="">&nbsp;<em>DAVID JULIAN - MUSICIAN</em><br><img src="DAVIDJULIAN.gif" width="143" height="145" border="0" align="left" alt=""><br>

David Julian, Daylight’s musician of few equals is a Past Master thrice over.  He first served the lodge as Master in 1989 and then again in 2001-2002 and 2002-2003.  He is now serving once again as the Grand Musician.  Prior to June 2005 the office was called Grand Organist but Brother David complained that he was not an organist but actually a musician and at Daylight’s suggestion the Grand Lodge agreed and changed the official title not only for Grand Lodge but in all Washington lodges.  He also served as Grand Bible bearing in 1997-1998 and is one of five members to have been the Deputy of the Grand Master in District # 5 from 1998-2000.  He is also musician for St. John’s Lodge # 9.

He furnished the entertainment for the 1983 Doric Lodge Installation of Officers.  When asked if he was a Mason, he explained that even though his father was a Past Master, because he worked nights he could not be one.  Wrong thing to say to a future Grand Master who promptly directed him to Daylight’s secretary and in June of 1983 his father helped raise him as a Master Mason. He brought a more up to date, refreshingly contemporary sound to the lodge when he became the lodge musician.

He attend college to study music but decided that practice was better than the professor’s theories and lectures, that the real world of performing was by far the best teacher so he left the University of Colorado School of Music to perform in concerts and night-clubs, to produce radio and TV commercials.  Now retired from full time club work, he runs his own business rescuing downed computers but continues to provide music for lodges, often with his wife Beverly.  He is also active as the leader of a small ‘pop’ guitar quartet that performs in the Seattle area.  In 2002 when asked to take the job of Master a third time, he agreed provided the young members found a way to rejuvenate the lodge and with the help of Anthony Monaco and Past Master Jay Losey lead the way to the lodge’s current success.

<em>ROBERT [ROB] PITRE III - TILER </em><br>
<img src="RobPitre.jpg" width="200" height="202" border="0" align="left" alt="">
Rob Pitre was first installed as Worshipful Master of the lodge on July 31, 2004 and for a second year on July 16, 2005 by Most Worshipful Sat Tashiro, Past Grand Master.  His successor Worshipful Master Monaco decided that a good place for him to serve the lodge would be outside the door checking any strangers who might visit.  As the youngest Past Master it was felt he would know many visitors and all members so he was given the ‘Tiler’s Sword” to protect the lodge in 2006-2007.   


Rob was born in New Orleans, raised mostly in southern Louisiana and moved with his family to the Kirkland area in 1987 where he completed high school.  In the early 1990s he lived and worked on the East Coast primarily in New York and New Jersey before returning to the great Northwest. 

As mentioned above he was raised as a Master Mason along with his best friend, Raleigh Wilson who is now his Senior Warden.  Knowing no local Masons and seeking a lodge, they contacted the Grand Secretary’s office and were directed to Daylight.  Contact with the lodge secretary decided them that Daylight was where they wanted to join because of the lodge’s support of the arts and the results are that he served two years governing the lodge 


Even though Pitre has never been actively involved in the arts like is his successor as Master, his support and interest prompted him to be a strong advocate of the lodge’s events such as the Seattle Youth Symphony Honors Dinner, the Fremont Solstice Festival and Fair Bandstand, the backstage Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra pizza party and other such activities. But he does claim a talent of beating out time as a hand drummer playing djembe and conga in various clubs in the Snoqualmie Valley. He now operates his own construction firm on the east side of Lake Washington.  “Uncle Rob” shares a large 1900s farmhouse in Carnation with Raleigh, Meagan, the kids, cats and menagerie.

<!--<img src="w.gif" width="32" height="16" border="0" alt="">&nbsp;<em>CLEO B. McCORD - Tiler</em><br><img src="tiler.gif" width="150" height="131" border="0" align="left" alt="">He may have been born November 25, 1912 in Muncie, Indiana but Tiler Cleo McCord is a prime example of the adage, “It isn’t age, it’s attitude.”  Cleo is often the first welcoming face a visitor or new members sees when he visits Daylight.   The new member being prepared to be made a Mason is sure to find Cleo guiding, advising and assuring them that they have made the right step in joining Daylight.  

Lodge records show that he was one of the oldest Masters of the lodge but his ideas have hardly been aged.  While he may not keep up with the lodge’s young officers physically, his ideas are very much in keeping with theirs and he believes that the future of Masonry and Daylight Lodge is now firmly in their hands.  During his year as Master in June of 1997 the lodge had its first contact with the Fremont Solstice Festival which was to lead to the highly successful band stand and Masonic Information Booth.

He first served as a Master in Spokane’s North Hill Lodge # 210 in 1962.  He was made a Mason in that lodge 1948 and affiliated with Daylight shortly after moving to the Masonic Retirement Center in 1994.  He served as the Master of Wayfarer’s Lodge # 280 in 1995 and also is tiler for Tyee # 115, the Wayfarer’s Daylight Lodge in Renton.  He was Junior Grand Steward in 1997-1998.  At his age he continues to be and inspiration to Daylight’s “kids” offering them sage advise, wise counsel and encouragement to try new ideas.
