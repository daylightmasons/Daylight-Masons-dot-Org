How do you join the Masons?  Surprise!  You dont get asked, you yourself ask.<br><br> Freemasons do not directly ask men to join.  Long tradition has established that an interested man asks a Mason to become a Mason.  This practice continues to this day, but with much less rigidity and secrecy than when our Grandfathers were Masons.<br><br>  Fifty years ago pamphlets about Masonry and the idea of a public websites like this would have been virtually unthinkable and explanations like this were rare and generally very frowned upon.<br><br>  But today we firmly believe Masonry is not a secret organization but an organization with a few secrets.  It is rather hard to be a secret organization when you can read about the lodge as you are now doing, find out where and when the lodge meets, etc., but one of the little known secrets is that you ask a Mason to get a petition. <br><br>
In the 21st Century Masons can and do discuss their Masonic activities with other men, indirectly urge them to become members but of course they still keep secret a few things pertaining to the degree work itself. It is an open Masonic secret that a good Mason is active in his community, his church, his labor union, his business organizations; he supports the government and actively contributes to many other organizations.

Masons take pride in acknowledging our extensive Masonic charities whether it is the thousands of scholarship and educational programs sponsored by Grand Lodges and local Blue Lodges, community support programs like Daylights Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra Principal Players Honors Dinner or a Bandstand and Masonic Information Booth at the Fremont Solstice Festival.  <br><br>

All members of the Masonic fraternity are just as proud of the of concordant bodies charities like Shrine Childrens Hospitals and Burn Clinics, Royal Arch Heart programs, Scottish Rite Speech and Hearing Clinics.  When you add to these, the charities and programs sponsored by Masonic related womens organizations, it is conservatively estimated that Masonic Charity in the United States is in excess of three million dollars a day.<br><br>  Any man seeking to join Masonry will become a part of this charity network helping people everywhere, fulfilling the Masonic lesson of Faith, Hope and Charity.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="frequentquestions.gif" width="466" height="41" border="0" alt="Frequently Asked Questions"><br>

<b>HOW DO I JOIN?</b><br>
The first step is contact the Lodge. (See "Request for Petition for Membership" information at the top of this page). One or more Masons will contact you and set up an initial interview process during which time you can find out more about Masonry and whether it is right for you.  If the interview is favorable you will be given a petition.  Once you fill out the petition it will be taken to the Lodge, voted on, and you're on your way to becoming a Mason!  Or, to be proactive, you can download a <a href="http://www.freemason-wa.org/FORMS/Petition%20Degrees1.pdf">Petition for the Degrees</a> (in .pdf format) and bring it with you to your interview.
<br><br>

<b>HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?</b><br>
Daylight Lodge, one of a few farsighted lodges in Washington has a unique joining or as Masons say, Petition Fee.  It is based on the State Minimum Wage.  It must be paid at the time of petitioning. The fee currently is $221.00 for Daylight Lodge but will change as the Minimum Wage changes. This fee includes the Lodge fee plus the Grand of Washington collects $50.00 for several different reasons including a Charity Fund and an Educational Scholarship Endowment Fund. Every petition includes $5.00 dedicated to the George Washington Masonic Memorial in Alexandria, Virginia.<br><br>

<b>CAN I START THE DEGREES AS SOON AS I PETITION?</b><br>
No. First the petition is presented to the Lodge at a regular meeting; it is then filed until the next meeting.  So it takes about thirty days, sometimes more.<br><br>

<b>WHEN I GET A PETITION, WHAT HAPPENS?</b><br>
First the petition needs sponsors.  If you know three Masons who will recommend you, they can sign the petition, if you don't, the members of the lodge who initially meet with you and give you the petition will sponsor you to the lodge.  After the Lodge receives the petition at a meeting, a group of three or more members will meet with you and if possible your family.  They will further discuss the lodge, why you want to join and answer some of the questions you might have.  They will also point out some of the things the Lodge expects from you as a member.  However this is nothing to be worried about.<br><br> 

<b>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A VOTE IS TAKEN?</b><br>
After the committee has met with you they make a recommendation to the Lodge and your petition is read a second time. At this time a vote is cast.  It is a secret vote but must be unanimous.  If the vote is favorable you are then scheduled for a degree conferral.<br><br>


<b>WHAT AND WHEN ARE THE DEGREES?</b><br>
There are three degrees in Masonry, each a little different from the previous one.  How soon you take you degrees depends on you and the Lodge schedule.  The degrees can be completed in one day or many months.  Usually it will take four or five months because Daylight does not encourage a one-day degree ceremony.  The three degrees are called The Entered Apprentice, The Fellowcraft and The Master Mason.<br><br>

<b>HOW SOON CAN I ATTEND THE MEETINGS?</b><br>
You can attend any time after you take your first degree.  You can attend any Lodge meeting that is opened and working on the degree of Masonry you hold. Daylight and many Washington Lodges run their business, called stated meetings, on the degree of the youngest brother present.  You are an active member as soon as you become a Mason, you just may not be able to hold office and a few things like that until you are a Master Mason.<br><br>

<b>WHAT IS THE AGE LIMIT?</b><br>
In Washington you must be eighteen, other Grand Lodges have different ages.<br><br>

<b>HOW MUCH ARE THE YEARLY DUES?</b><br>
Daylight Lodge dues like the Petition Fee is based on the minimum wage times hours; hours because Masons always refer to their meetings as "at labor."  Dues average around $15.00 a month or $183.00 a year.  They always include the yearly Grand Lodges dues.<br><br>

<b>IF THERE ARE THREE DEGREES IN MASONRY, WHAT IS THE 33<sup><span class="style2">rd</span></sup> ?</b><br>
There are organizations related to Freemasonry, usually called concordant bodies, which to join require Masonic membership.  Membership in these bodies is not required and Daylight does not necessarily encourage joining them until you have been a Mason for some time.  Most notable are York Rite and Scottish Rite.  The 33<sup><span class="style2">rd</span></sup>  is an honorary degree in Scottish Rite.  It is NOT a higher degree. There is no higher degree that the Third or Master Mason Degree and no higher honor can be given any Mason than the White Lambskin Apron that all Masons wear with pride.<br><br>

<b>WHAT IS A MASONIC APRON?</b><br>
The Lambskin or leather apron is the ancient badge of a Mason.  One has been presented to every man who has become a Freemason from "time immemorial," whether he be rich or poor, from the high or the low, prince or president.  It is the first thing a lodge gives a new brother.  It is symbolically an emblem of innocence to always remind him of a purity of life and rectitude of conductor.  It is the true badge of a Mason, cherished by all who have ever worn one.<br><br>

<b>WHO IS THE SUPREME HEAD OF MASONS?</b><br>
The answer to the question is "NO ONE."  Each Grand Lodge like the Grand Lodge of Washington has supreme authority in its jurisdiction.  Of course one Grand Lodge talks to another but each adopts its own official policies.  There are two Grand Lodges within political boundaries of Washington State, The Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Washington and the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Washington and Jurisdiction.  But each makes its own rules and elects its own officers.  All recognized lodges in Washington are a member of one of these two Grand Lodges.<br><br>

<b>DOES MASONRY DISCRIMINATE?</b><br>
No, every man is judged on his own qualities as a man. Masonry asks only that a 
man have a belief and place his ultimate trust in a Supreme Being or Higher 
Power, it does not ask which one. You may well find several different Sacred 
Books on many lodge Altars. Such is the case at Daylight Lodge. It does not ask 
a man's race. In fact Past Grand Master of Masons in Washington, M&#8756; W&#8756; Satoru 
&#65533;Sat&#65533; Tashiro is of Japanese ancestry, the Grand Lodge&#65533;s Junior Grand Warden and 
future Grand Master is R&#8756;W&#8756; G. Santy Lascano who is proud of his Philippine 
heritage. There are many so-called minorities who are members and officers in 
any number of lodges including Daylight.  It is sometimes asked can Gays join the Masons?  Today, sexual orientation is seldom a factor in determining admission. Women may not join regular Freemasonry but there are a number of Masonic related organizations for them with important charities. <br><br>

<b>WHAT EVENTS CAN WOMEN ATTEND?</b><br>
Many Lodges hold a public installation of officers during the year. Wives, family and friends can attend this event.  While it doesn't have any of the ceremonies of the regular degree work, it does have the same flavor and explains some of the symbolism use in masonry.  This is one way the non-Mason can get an idea of the ritual of Masonry.  Lodges may have special social events with wives and friends invited.<br><br>
